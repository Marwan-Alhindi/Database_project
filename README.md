An  effective  rollout  of  vaccinations  against  COVID-19  offers  the  most  promising  prospect  of 
bringing  the  pandemic  to  an  end.  We  present  the  Our  World  in  Data  COVID-19  vaccination 
dataset,  a  global  public  dataset  that  tracks  the  scale  and  rate  of  the  vaccine  rollout  across  the 
world.  This  dataset  is  updated  regularly  and  includes  data  on  the  total  number  of  vaccinations 
administered, first and second doses administered, daily vaccination rates and population-
adjusted coverage for all countries for which data are available (169 countries as of 7 April 2021). 
It will be maintained as the global vaccination campaign continues to progress. This resource aids 
policymakers  and researchers in understanding the rate  of current and potential vaccine  rollout; 
the  interactions  with  non-vaccination  policy  responses;  the  potential  impact  of  vaccinations  on 
pandemic  outcomes  such  as  transmission,  morbidity  and  mortality;  and  global  inequalities  in 
vaccine access. 

A  live  version  of  the  vaccination  dataset  and  documentation  are  available  in  a  public  GitHub  repository  at 
https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations. These data can be 
downloaded in CSV and JSON formats.
